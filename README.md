This code is a toDo for IOS devices
I used UIButton, UILabel. UIKit, CoreData, UITableView, SnapKit.
The app can add tasks, which you can check and uncheck, there are two ways to delete task, via dragging it to left and using EditButton.
EditButton enables editing mode, where you can drag tasks or delete them.
AddButton adds new tasks by calling popUpView with two textFields.
For locating data I used CoreData


In order to use this code u need Xcode with Swift 5, Snapkit and CoreData installed, in addition you might gonna need app Sf Symbols to images appear.
